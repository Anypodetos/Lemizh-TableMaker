09|How many different actions occur in the following sentence?|||

|Which actions do the cases in the following sentence characterise completely?|||
||(speak)á wiè (3/4)ÌaR.|2|The inner accusative of <lem>(3/4)Ì.</lem> characterises the weighting numeral; all other cases, including the main predicate’s inner case, characterise the speaking.
|What can you conclude from the presence of the word <lem>(green)Ì.</lem> ‘green’ in the following sentence, apart from that we are talking about all the <em>green</em> rooms?|||
||(1/1)Ì (room)Ìyn (green)Ìy.|3|It isn’t clear from context that we are talking about <em>green</em> rooms; e.g., this hasn’t been established until now.
|Can you tell whether the beavers in the following sentences exist, and by which kind of reality?|||
||(see)à (beaver)Ìi.|4|‘The beaver sees something’: so he must exist, per pragmatic reality.
||(see)à (beaver)Ìe.|5|‘Someone sees the beaver’: which might be an illusion.
||(see)è (beaver)Ìe.|6|‘the beaver, the seen one = There is a seen beaver’: the bracket confers grammatical reality on the beaver.
||(love)à veè (see)èy (beaver)Ìe.|7|‘I love the seen beaver’: the bracket only confers second-level grammatical reality on the beaver, so it might still be an illusion.
|Translate and compound, and invert the translations unless inversion ban applies:|||
||(He eats nothing-acc.)|8|<lem>(not)à (eat)Ìy. => (eat)y(not)à.</lem> (inversion ban)

|Why didn’t we translate the last exercise (as well as ‘more spirit’) with <lem>(amount)y(more)ìl —</lem>?||7|As <lem>(more)à.</lem> is a sub-category verb of <lem>(amount)à.</lem>, the latter can absorb the former:\u10?<lem>(more)ìl (amount)Ìy (hair)Ìy. <=> (amount)ìl (hair)yÌ (more)Ìy. -> (more)ìl (hair)Ìy.</lem>
|In translating ‘Fantasy is as thin as air’, how would we include the information that fantasy and air are very thin?||8|<lem>(dense)ìl (fantasy)yÌ (air)yÌm (1/8)Ìilm.</lem>\u10?(The numeral has to be in the qualitative case; otherwise the sentence would mean ‘There is hardly a density of fantasy like the one of air; it is hardly the case that fantasy is as thin as air’.

|Why is it always possible to remove a bracket’s predicate from a sentence without breaking any dependencies?||9|First convert the bracket into the corresponding coordination. Then you can remove the object that originally was the bracket’s predicate.
